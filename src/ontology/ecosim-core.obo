Spring leafout refers to the sprouting and growth of new leaves in plants during the spring season, while dehardening refers to the process by which plants transition from a dormant, hardened state to an active, growing state. The mobilization of nonstructural carbon refers to the utilization and movement of stored carbon reserves within the vegetation for the purpose of new growth and development during this period. This parameter tracks the accumulation and release of nonstructural carbon during leafout and dehardening, providing information on the timing and intensity of this process in Earth system models."

Nonstructural elements are organic compounds that are not part of the plant's structural tissues but are important for energy storage and metabolism. The concentration of these elements in the root layer can influence various processes, including nutrient uptake, plant growth, and carbon cycling within the ecosystem. This parameter is relevant for earth system modeling as it provides insights into the carbon dynamics and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems." []

It involves selectively removing certain individuals or groups of plants to create more space and resources for the remaining plants to grow and thrive. Thinning can be done manually or through natural processes such as competition, predation, or disease. The purpose of thinning plant populations in earth systems modeling is to simulate realistic vegetation dynamics, including changes in species composition, productivity, and ecosystem functioning."
